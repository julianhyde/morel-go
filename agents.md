# Development notes for Claude

## Commit discipline

**Every commit must pass `fullMake`.** Run `fullMake --no-clean`
from the repository root and confirm it passes before you commit —
including each commit of a multi-commit change, since commits are
cherry-picked and squashed from work branches onto `main` and must
be green independently. For morel-go, `fullMake` builds
(`go build`), lints (`golangci-lint run`, which includes vet and
formatting checks), and runs the tests (`go test`). Never commit
if it fails; fix the code until it is green.

**Never mix planning changes with code changes in one commit.**
Planning changes (`plan.md`) and code changes (everything else,
including `agents.md`) go in separate commits, so that either kind
can be cherry-picked onto `main` without the other. If a piece of
work updates both, make two commits.

## Repositories

Morel has implementations in Go, Rust, and Java. The repositories
are [morel-go](https://github.com/hydromatic/morel-go),
[morel-rust](https://github.com/hydromatic/morel-rust), and
[morel-java](https://github.com/hydromatic/morel).

morel-java is the reference implementation; morel-go and morel-rust
are ports of it. A common task is to propagate a change from one
repository into another — usually from morel-java (or morel-rust)
into morel-go.

> morel-go is early-stage, so some tooling referenced below (the
> script harness, `etc/check-convergence.py`) is described by
> `plan.md` and will appear as the port matures.

## Two forms of script

A script in `testdata/script/` comes in one of two forms, and the
difference is where its expected output lives.

A **`.smli` script is idempotent**: it carries its own expected
output, on `> `-prefixed lines after each statement, and running it
reproduces the file. This is the form almost everything uses.

A **`.sml` script carries no expected output**; its transcript is
the companion `.sml.out` file — every input line echoed, and after
each statement the output it produced, unprefixed and followed by a
blank line. The form earns its keep for a script whose output you
would not want interleaved with it: one that `use`s another file,
where the whole of the inner file's transcript lands in the middle
of the outer one.

**Two things pick the form**, as they do in morel-java. First the
script harness is engaged, by `--idempotent` or by a first file
ending `.smli`; without it every source is an ordinary program,
streamed, so `morel prog.sml` runs a program, which is what `.sml`
ordinarily means. Then, within the harness, the extension picks:
`.smli` is rewritten, anything else has its transcript written, and
standard input is read as `.smli` would be. `Args.FormOf` is the one
place that decides, and `TestScripts` — one walker over both
extensions — reaches the same two forms directly.

Both forms count towards convergence. `etc/check-convergence.py`
measures `.smli`, `.sml` and `.sml.out` alike, so a divergence in a
transcript is as visible as one in a script.

## Growing the test corpus

The `.smli` corpus (in `testdata/script/`) is grown
component-by-component, not imported whole. When implementing a
feature, pull in the hunks of `.smli` that morel-java added for
that feature and that have not changed significantly since. Pulled
hunks are verbatim from java's present-day files — never adapted
for Go.

Never disable a section inside a `.smli` file. morel-go does not
use `set("mode","validate")` brackets or `(* ... *)` disablement
(a morel-rust mistake — it was very hard to tell which sections
were disabled, and every edit is divergence from java). A section
exists in a morel-go `.smli` file only when it passes; what is
missing is exactly what the divergence report shows. Sole
exception: `Sys.plan` output is matched best-effort, and a plan
line that is infeasible to match may be commented out.

## Propagation process

Once a `.smli` file has caught up with morel-java, changes to it
are propagated commit-by-commit.

### Reading the source change

Read the commit message, the code changes, and especially the test
changes in the java repository's
`src/test/resources/script/*.smli`.

### Implementing the feature

Move every changed `.smli` section from morel-java verbatim — all
sections, always; never adapt, trim, or skip a section because the
implementation is hard. (Dropping and adapting sections were
costly mistakes in morel-rust.) Then implement the feature in Go.

### Verifying

Run `fullMake --no-clean` and confirm it passes. The gates, all of
which must pass before committing:

- `fullMake` (build, lint, tests);
- `etc/check-convergence.py --java-repo <morel-java clone> HEAD` —
  per-file divergence from morel-java may never increase; a
  propagation should show it decreasing. `--java-repo` is required and
  has no default: pick a clone that contains the commit named in the
  `Propagates` line, and check `~/dev/plan.md` for which clone is
  current. The gate compares that commit and its parent, so the answer
  does not change as morel-java moves on.

New tests originate in morel-java: add them there first, then
propagate back — do not grow a go-only test fork. One go-local
script is an exception. The corpus regeneration tooling
(`pull-passing --apply`, `era_trim`, whole-file regens) leaves it
alone, but only because of how it picks its files: it works on the
*shared* ones, `go_files & java_files`, so a go-local script is safe
exactly as long as morel-java has no file of that name.

**So the name is the protection, and it is not reserved.** If
morel-java creates a file that collides, the script is no longer
go-local as far as the tooling can tell: `pull-passing --apply`
starts from morel-java's copy and only ever deletes from it, so the
go-only content is not merged — it is dropped, quietly, in a run
that looks like an ordinary pull. Give a go-local script a name
morel-java will not want. That is what happened on 2026-09-15, when
morel-java added a `parse.smli` of its own; the scaffolding that
collided with it has since been upstreamed, which is the better end
for a go-local script than a rename.

The one:

- `backswing.smli`, regression tests for bugs fixed in morel-go
  that morel-java's corpus does not yet pin. Each entry names the
  bug and the upstream `.smli` file its statements belong in; a
  future "backswing" task in morel-java adopts them there, after
  which a pull returns them and they are deleted from here (see
  `plan.md` task R45).

### Commit message

Use the original morel-java commit summary as the first line of the
commit message. Append a blank line and then a propagation line
that cites the morel-java issue and commit SHA:

```
Join (hydromatic/morel#72)

Add clauses to `from` to support inner joins. We continue to
allow comma joins, but only up until the first step (`where`,
`join`, `group`, `yield` or `order` keyword). After that,
commas would introduce ambiguity when combined with the
commas in `group` or `compute`.

We will add outer joins (`left`, `right`, `full` keywords)
in a later commit.

Propagates hydromatic/morel#72 commit ab102172
```

If a morel-java commit uses the old `[MOREL-NNN]` format, convert
it to the new format `hydromatic/morel#NNN`. For example,
`[MOREL-72] Join` becomes `Join (hydromatic/morel#72)`.

## Regular development

Regular features (originating in morel-go) use a commit message
that references the morel-go issue:

```
Add `banner`, `productName`, `productVersion` properties (#30)

Add three new read-only properties to the Sys structure.

Fixes #30
```

## Quick experiments

To run a single Morel expression from the shell, pass `-e` (or
`--eval`, or `--eval=EXPR`) to the binary; the result is printed
and the process exits. Useful when reproducing a bug from a
one-liner without needing a script file:

```
$ go build ./cmd/morel
$ ./morel -e '1 + 2'
val it = 3 : int
$ ./morel --eval='from x in [1,2,3] yield x * 2'
val it = [2,4,6] : int list
```
