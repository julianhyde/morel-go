## <a href="https://github.com/hydromatic/morel-go/releases/tag/v0.8.0">v0.8.0</a> / 2026-08-04

Initial release.

Go version numbers start with 'v'. The number starts at v0.8.0,
rather than v0.1.0, so that it matches the release of
[Morel Java](https://github.com/hydromatic/morel) that this release is
compatible with.

There are too many changes to list here. Our goal is to be compatible
with the Morel language as implemented by Morel Java, and our strategy
is to copy the `.smli` test scripts from that project and get them to
pass. Compatibility is therefore measured by how much of Morel Java's
script corpus Morel Go reproduces line for line; at this release, it
is about 87%.

Key features:
 * The parser is complete, apart from attributes and quoted
   identifiers; it parses 94% of the statements in Morel Java's
   corpus, and almost all of the rest are `:t` test-harness
   directives.
 * Type resolution (via the Hindley-Milner algorithm and unification)
   and evaluation are complete for expressions, function
   declarations, `datatype` and `type` declarations, and the built-in
   types including `list`, `bag`, `vector`, `option` and `either`.
 * The relational extensions work: `from`, `join` (including `left`,
   `right` and `full` outer joins), `where`, `group`, `compute`,
   `order`, `skip`, `take`, `yield`, `yieldAll` and `into`.
 * Datalog is supported.
 * There are 460 built-in values in 25 structures.
   [`Bool`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/bool.html),
   [`Char`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/char.html),
   [`Date`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/date.html),
   [`Fn`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/fn.html),
   [`General`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/general.html),
   [`Int`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/integer.html),
   [`List`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/list.html),
   [`ListPair`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/list-pair.html),
   [`Math`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/math.html),
   [`Option`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/option.html),
   [`Real`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/real.html),
   [`String`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/string.html),
   [`StringCvt`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/string-cvt.html),
   [`Time`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/time.html),
   [`Vector`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/vector.html) and
   [`Word`](https://smlfamily.github.io/Basis/word.html)
   are based on the Standard ML Basis Library;
   [`Either`](https://github.com/SMLFamily/BasisLibrary/wiki/2015-002-Addition-of-Either-module)
   is a proposed extension to the Standard ML Basis Library; and
   `Bag`,
   `Datalog`,
   `Interact`,
   `PP`,
   `Range`,
   `Relational`,
   `Sys` and
   `Variant`
   are Morel-specific.
 * The shell runs script files or standard input, evaluates a single
   expression given with `-e`, and checks a script against its
   expected output in `.smli` (idempotent) format.

Among the remaining tasks to achieve parity with Morel Java are
`exception` declarations and `handle`; `structure`, `signature` and
`open`; `local`; `while`; references; user-defined operators;
overloaded functions (`over` and `val inst`, which parse but do not
compile); and external data, from the file system or from a database
via ODBC or JDBC.

The shell has no command-line editing and no history: there is no
up-arrow recall, and nothing is saved between sessions.
