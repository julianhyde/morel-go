"""Regenerate morel-go's `.smli` files as the largest subset of
morel-java's that morel-go reproduces.

For each shared file it starts from java's copy and repeatedly
runs it through the morel-go binary built from the current tree,
dropping every statement whose replayed output differs from
java's (a statement morel-go cannot yet reproduce — an
unimplemented member, `Sys.plan`, and so on). Dropping a
statement can change a later one's output, so it iterates to a
fixed point.

Because it only ever DELETES whole statements from java's file,
the result is always an ordered subsequence of java: a `diff`
against java shows insertions only, never a line go has that java
lacks or a line in the wrong place. Both invariants — the result
round-trips through morel-go, and it is a subsequence of java —
are asserted before anything is written. (The previous
insert-into-go design could silently misplace a pulled block;
this cannot.)

Report mode (the default) prints, per shared file, java's size,
the regenerated size, and the current go size, and lists java
files go does not have yet. Apply mode (--apply) writes the
regenerated files.

Because it builds morel-go from the working tree and takes java
as a fixed reference, it can run against any morel-go commit:
check the commit out and run it.

Usage:
    etc/pull-passing.py [--apply] [--java-repo PATH] [FILE...]

FILE args (relative to testdata/script, e.g. simple.smli) limit
the run to those files; the default is every shared file.
