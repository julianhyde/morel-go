"""Gate and dashboard for convergence of morel-go's script test
files toward morel-java's.

Gate mode (the default) checks one commit: for every shared
script file it compares the number of lines differing from
morel-java BEFORE the commit (at the parents) and AFTER. It fails
if any file became MORE divergent — a section that java changed
but go did not follow, even if other files converged enough to
hide it in the net. The java commit is read from the go commit's
`Propagates ... commit <sha>` line. A commit without one is refused:
it used to be compared against whatever the java checkout was at,
which made the answer depend on when the gate ran rather than on what
the commit did.

Report mode (--report) is the project dashboard: per-file
divergence of the working tree against the java checkout's
working tree, java files not yet pulled, and go-only files.

Ledger mode (--ledger) lists the java commits already propagated,
read from `Propagates` lines in the git log.

Usage:
    etc/check-convergence.py --java-repo PATH [GO_COMMIT]
                             [--java JAVA_SHA] [--verbose]
    etc/check-convergence.py --java-repo PATH --report
                             [--go-rev REV] [--java-rev REV]
    etc/check-convergence.py --ledger

`--java-repo` is required and has no default: see the comment on it
below. Nothing else about the measurement is implicit either -- the
gate compares GO_COMMIT against its parent, and the morel-java commit
named in GO_COMMIT's `Propagates` line against *its* parent, so the
answer depends on the two commits and not on where either repository
happens to be checked out. Running the gate on an old commit today
gives what it gave when that commit was made.

`--report` is the exception, and is a dashboard rather than a gate: by
default it compares working trees, which is a snapshot. Name
`--go-rev` and `--java-rev` when the number has to mean the same thing
twice.
